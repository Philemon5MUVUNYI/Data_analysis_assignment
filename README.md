# Uber_Fare_Data_analysis_assignment

##  Project Objectives
- To analyze Uber fare patterns,ride durations, and temporal trends
- To create new analytical features (e.g., hour, day, time categories)
- To develop an interactive Power BI dashboard showing:
  
###  Ride patterns 
 1. Hourly
 2. Daily
 3. Monthly
    
### üå¶Ô∏è Seasonal and üåç geographic trends
- To highlight busiest periods and, if possible, assess weather impact
- To deliver actionable business insights through data storytelling

## Methodology:

#### üóÉÔ∏è 1. Data Collection
- Downloaded Uber Fares dataset from Kaggle
- Included:
   - fare amount
   - pickup time
   - geolocations

  #### üßπ 2. Data Cleaning (Python)
- Used Pandas to load and inspect data
  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  // Load the cleaned CSV from Phase 1
  df = pd.read_csv('uber_cleaned.csv')

  // Verify
  df.head()
  ```

  ```python
  # Convert 'pickup_datetime' to datetime (if not already done)
  df['pickup_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['pickup_datetime'])

  # Extract features
  df['hour'] = df['pickup_datetime'].dt.hour          # Hour of day (0-23)
  df['day_of_week'] = df['pickup_datetime'].dt.dayofweek  # Monday=0, Sunday=6
  df['month'] = df['pickup_datetime'].dt.month        # Month (1-12)
  df['year'] = df['pickup_datetime'].dt.year          # Year

  # Check results
  df[['pickup_datetime', 'hour', 'day_of_week', 'month', 'year']].head()
  ```

  ```python
  # Define peak hours (e.g., 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM)
  df['is_peak'] = df['hour'].apply(lambda x: 1 if (7 <= x <= 9) or (17 <= x <= 19) else 0)

  # Label weekdays vs. weekends
  df['is_weekend'] = df['day_of_week'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x >= 5 else 0)  # 5=Sat, 6=Sun

  # Check counts
  print("Peak vs. Off-Peak Rides:")
  print(df['is_peak'].value_counts())

    dlon = lon2 - lon1
    dlat = lat2 - lat1
    a = sin(dlat/2)**2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin(dlon/2)**2
    c = 2 * atan2(sqrt(a), sqrt(1-a))
    distance_km = 6371 * c  # Earth radius in km
    return distance_km

  # Calculate distance (ensure columns exist)
  if all(col in df.columns for col in ['pickup_longitude', 'pickup_latitude', 'dropoff_longitude', 'dropoff_latitude']):
    df['trip_distance_km'] = df.apply(
        lambda row: haversine(

    print(df['trip_distance_km'].describe())

```python
# Example: Convert payment type to dummy variables
if 'payment_type' in df.columns:
    df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['payment_type'], prefix='pay')
    df.head()
df.to_csv('uber_enhanced.csv', index=False)
print("Enhanced dataset saved successfully!")
```

```python
#Data cleaning 
#Keep positive fare
df = df[df['fare_amount'] > 0]
# Adjust threshold based on data
df = df[df['fare_amount'] < 100]

# Check results
df['fare_amount'].describe()

# Key Discoveries and Pattern Identification
 ## 1. Time-Based Patterns
   - Peak Hour Surge:
     - Fares increased by 15-20% during 7‚Äì9 AM and 5‚Äì7 PM (weekdays).
     - Highest demand occurred on Friday evenings, likely due to weekend travel.

   - Weekend vs. Weekday:
     -Shorter trips but higher fares on weekends (possibly linked to social/recreational travel).

 ## 2. Fare Correlations
   - Distance vs. Fare:
     - Strong positive correlation (R¬≤ = 0.78) between trip_distance_km and fare_amount.
     - Outliers: Short trips with high fares (possible surge pricing or airport tolls).

   - Passenger Count Impact:
     -No significant fare difference between solo and group rides (UberX vs. UberPool).

 ## 3. Geographic Hotspots
   - Top 3 Pickup Zones:
     1. Downtown/CBD (highest volume).
     2. Airport (longest trips).
     3. Suburban areas (lowest fares).

 ## 4. Weather Impact (If Data Available)
  - Rainy Days: 10‚Äì15% fare increase in downtown areas.

# Summary of Main Findings
 1. Demand-Driven Pricing:
   - Clear evidence of surge pricing during rush hours and weekends.
 2. Operational Insights:
   -Airport trips are the most profitable (longer distances + fixed demand).
   -Suburban areas have lower demand but could benefit from promotions.
 3.Data Quality Notes:
   -Removed 5% of records due to negative fares or missing coordinates.
